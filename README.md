# Jamies Test
Very simply the test showing where I am currently.

## Installation

```npm install ```

## Usage

```Npm start```

## Notes

I have to admit, I am slightly embarrassed to send this over, not only is the quality of code not terrible well thought out, nor with any refectoring. Its current has zero tests or lints

My plans would normally but, to use jest and snapsnots to for each component and most likely expect for unit testing the reducers

As for litning I've recently been using prettier along with eslint for my code.

This was completed in about an hour and a half as I spent a little bit of time getting the project set up, I could have just used create-react-app but I wanted to include redux, I think maybe I shouldn't have given the time constraint :D

Here are some tests i completed on thursday and friday, although you can't see what the task was, it might help you a little bit with how I write my day-to-day code
